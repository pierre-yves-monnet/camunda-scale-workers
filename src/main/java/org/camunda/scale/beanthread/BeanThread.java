/**
 * This worker use a simple thread, one execution at a time.
 * The execution immediately register the work in a executorPool, and return. Execution is then delay.
 * To protect the machine, the executorPool creates maximum 20 threads at a time. So, maximum 20 executions is processed
 * Attention:
 * - Because the handling is very fast (just register the work to do), if there is 2000 tasks on the Camunda Engine, this worker will get all, and put in the queue.
 * If there is an another worker in the system, it will have nothing to do, and this worker will have a large list to process
 * - after X ms, task is unlocked. Then, Camunda Engine will propose the same task, and this worker will get it twice.
 *  In the executorPool, task is register twice and will be executed twice.
 *
 *  Use this pattern only if the job is small and can the queue is not very big. Else see beanthreadlimitation package
